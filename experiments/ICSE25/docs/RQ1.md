# Replicating Results for RQ1

## Scanning packages using each Tool

In this section, we describe how to rerun each of the tool to generate the results for the analysis in 
rest of the sections RQ1-4. 

### Hercule
Use following bash script to reproduce the results for each of the data-set using `hercule`

```bash
bash scripts/run/run-hercule.sh
```

### GuardDog
Use following bash script to reproduce the results for each of the data-set using `guarddog`

```bash
bash scripts/run/run-guarddog.sh
```


### MalOSS
Use following bash script to reproduce the results for each of the data-set using `maloss`

```bash
bash scripts/run/run-maloss.sh
```

### Bandit4Mal
Use following bash script to reproduce the results for each of the data-set using `bandit4mal`

```bash
bash scripts/run/run-bandit.sh
```



## SOTA Detailed Comparison (Table-II)
Once all the results are placed, following script will aggregate the results as shown in Table-II
Run the script using the command
```bash
python3 scripts/analysis/table-2.py
```
It will output the results for each tool-dataset combination as follows:
```bash
    ----- hercule ------
    DataSet TP FP TN FN
    popular 0 0 97 0

```

## SOTA High-Level Comparison (Table-III)
Upon completing the previous step, which will generate the aggregated data, following script will compute the results as shown in Table-III
Run the script using the command
```bash
python3 scripts/analysis/table-3.py
```
It will output the results for each tool-dataset combination as follows:
```bash
    Tool Precision Recall F1-Score FP-Rate Accuracy
    hercule 1.0 0.8801652892561983 0.9362637362637362 0.0 0.9144542772861357
```
