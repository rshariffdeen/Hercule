# Replicating Results for RQ3

This experiment requires running of one additional tool `lastpymile` which is implemented
as part of `hercule`. In order to generate the results of `lastpymile`, we have prepared a separate script.

```bash
bash scripts/run/run-lastpymile.sh
```


## Impact of Integrity Analysis (Table-V)
Once completing the steps in [RQ1](RQ1.md) and above instructions for `lastpymile`, which will generate the experiment data, following script will compute the results as shown in Table-III
Run the script using the command
```bash
python3 scripts/analysis/table-5.py
```
It will output the results for each tool-dataset combination as follows:
```bash
    DataSet BanditMal LastPyMile Hercule
    popular 19900 3562 (82.10) 2241 (88.74)

```
