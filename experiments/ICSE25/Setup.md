# Setup Instructions
### Hardware Requirements
All experiments were conducted using Ubuntu 18.04 operating system on a 192-core 2.40GHz 512G RAM Intel Xeon
machine (x64).


### Docker Preliminaries
* Ensure you have `docker` installed.
  See: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-16-04
* Ensure you have added yourself to the `docker` group: `sudo usermod -a -G
  docker <username>`. You will need to log back in to see the permissions take effect.

## Downloading Packages
The replication package requires python packages downloaded from PyPI, grouped into several
multiple datasets. The packages can be downloaded from the following [Zenodo Link](https://zenodo.org/records/14580885)
The archive is password protected for safe distribution purposes, you can email Ridwan Shariffdeen (rshariffdeen@ieee.org) to obtain the password.

* MalOSS: subset of malicious packages from MalOSS dataset [RQ1, RQ2, RQ4]
* BackStabber: subset of malicious packages from BackStabber Knife's Collection [RQ1, RQ2, RQ4]
* MalRegistry: subset of malicious packages from Python MalRegistry dataset [RQ1, RQ2, RQ4]
* Popular: a collection of top-100 most popular python packages from PyPI [RQ1, RQ2, RQ3, RQ4]
* Trusted: a collection of packages from trusted organizations hosted in PyPI [RQ1, RQ2, RQ3, RQ4]
* DataKund: a collection of newly identified malicious packages from PyPI [Case Study]
* Recent: a collection of packages that were recently (2024 Oct) added to PyPI [Macaron Case Study]

Download the packages from following link
```bash
wget https://zenodo.org/records/14580885/files/packages.tar.gz.enc
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -iter 10000 -d -in packages.tar.gz.enc -out packages.tar.gz
tar -xf packages.tar.gz
export EXTRACTED_PATH=$PWD
```


## Building the environment
Please note that the environment to run the experiments requires building 2 docker images and pulling 1 docker mage:
* Docker image for Hercule tool and its dependencies (to build Hercule)
* Docker image for experiment environment and its dependencies to run baseline tools
* Docker image for Maloss

Setup environment can be built using the Dockerfile provided within, which will encompass the dependencies, configurations
and setup scripts. Use the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rshariffdeen/Hercule.git

# building docker image for Hercule
cd Hercule
docker build -t rshariffdeen/hercule:22.04 .

# copy the packages extracted in previous step before building the experiment image
# note: ensure 7 tarballs exist in `experiments/ICSE25/packages` directory
cp -r $EXTRACTED_PATH/packages experiments/ICSE25/packages

# building docker image for experiments
cd experiments/ICSE25
docker build -t rshariffdeen/hercule:icse25 .
docker pull mirchevmp/maloss
```

For reproducing `MalOSS` experiments we have pre-built a separate docker image which should be downloaded using the following command
```bash
docker pull mirchevmp/maloss
```

Having the image, you can now start a Docker container. 
Note: please make sure to use the correct image which has the dependencies installed for Linux kernel (i.e. rshariffdeen/hercule:icse25)

[comment]: <> (We recommend linking the container to folders in the filesystem,)
[comment]: <> (so that it is possible to check the logs and generated outputs also outside of the Docker container. )

```bash
docker run --name Hercule -it -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock rshariffdeen/hercule:icse25 bash
```
