# Manual #
Hercule is a supply chain malware detection tool for Python packages. It performs a series of analysis [integrity, behavior and dependency] to determine if the scanning
package is malicious or benign. It requires as input a Python package file (.whl, .zip, .tar.gz etc) or a directory containing multiple packages. 



# Runtime Configuration Options
The tool supports the following runtime configurations:

    usage: Hercule [options]
    
    Optional arguments:
      --banditmal           use bandit4mal mode
      --cache               use cached information for the process
      --cpu-count CPU_COUNT
                            max amount of CPU cores which can be used by Hercule
      --debug, -d           print debugging information
      --enable-bandit       enable bandit analysis
      --lastpymile          use lastpymile mode
      --no-dependencies     do not track the dependencies of the project
      --purge               clean everything after the experiment
      --ui                  run the UI module

### Side effects ###

**Warning!** Hercule executes arbitrary modifications of your environment which may lead to undesirable side effects. Therefore, it is recommended to run Hercule in an isolated environment (i.e. Docker container).
Apart from that, Hercule produces the following side effects:

- prints log messages on the standard error output
- saves generated reports in the current directory (i.e. results)
- saves intermediate data in the current directory (i.e. experiments)
- saves various log information in the current directory (i.e. logs)
- extracts/analyze/read/transform files from the provided package

If Hercule does not terminate successfully (e.g. by receiving `SIGKILL`), the experiment directory is likely to be corrupted.
