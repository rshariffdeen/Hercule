# Example Usage
In this document we provide examples of how to use Hercule with prepared 
test cases to elaborate the capabilities of Hercule. Following details explain
the test-cases we provide in our repository. Please take a look at the
page Getting Started to understand how to use Hercule. 

## Single Package
Hercule supports analyzing packages in different formats, i.e., wheels, zips, .tar.gz files, by passing the flag `--file/-F` . To invoke the tool, call
`hercule -F target_package`. Below we show an example run using one of the test packages `six-1.16.0.tar.gz` located in `tests\benign-packages`.

Command to scan the package
```bash
hercule -F tests/benign-packages/six-1.16.0.tar.gz 
```

Analysis results

Hercule generates several artifacts that can be inspected for further details of the analysis.

results. 


## Batch Mode
Hercule can be invoked on a collection of collected packages using the `--dir/-D` flag to allow for batch mode processing, e.g.
`hercule -D directory_of_packages`

Example command for test packages in the repository
```bash
hercule -D tests/benign-packages
```
